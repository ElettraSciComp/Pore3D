## Pore3D

Pore3D is a software toolbox for quantitative analysis of three-dimensional images.

The core of Pore3D consists in a set of state-of-the-art functions and procedures for performing filtering, segmentation, skeletonization and quantitative analysis of three-dimensional data. Although three-dimensional data can be produced by several techniques (for instance: magnetic resonance, x-ray scattering or confocal microscopy), the library was developed and optimized for micro-CT (Computed Tomography) data.

Pore3D features are available through the high-level scripting environment [IDL](http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/ProductsandSolutions/GeospatialProducts/IDL.aspx). Pore3D has been tested with IDL 64-bit from versions 6.4 to 8.1.

## Installation

Binaries for Windows 64-bit are provided. The .zip file can be downloaded from the Releases section of this GitHub repository (https://github.com/ElettraSciComp/Pore3D/releases/).

Decompress the .zip file and make the extracted .dll and .dlm files visible to [IDL](http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/ProductsandSolutions/GeospatialProducts/IDL.aspx). The simplest way for this is to copy the Pore3D files into an internal IDL folder similar to C:\Program Files\Exelis\IDL85\bin\bin.x86_64 . 

## Documentation

User documentation in HTML format can be downloaded from the Releases section of this GitHub repository (https://github.com/ElettraSciComp/Pore3D/releases/). Just decompress the .zip file and run the "Open Guide" link (or equivalently browse the internal folder and open with your Internet browser the file named Index.html).
